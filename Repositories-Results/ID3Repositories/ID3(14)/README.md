ID3
===

This is the ID3 decision Tree algorithm implementation in Java for discrete attributes only.
It accepts two command line arguments:
Argument 1 : File name to Learn from.
Argument 2 : File name to Test from.
The format of the source files is as described:: The first line holds the attribute names, each name followed by an integer representing the number of possible values for that attribute. Each following line defines a single example. Each column holds this exampleâ€™s value for the attribute given at the top of the file (same order). The last column holds the class label for the examples
